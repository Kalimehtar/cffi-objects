CFFI-objects is a library, that enhances CFFI with several new constructions to use when you need to work with complex structures or objects.

It supports structures by-value and by-reference with and without saving C-pointer on lisp side. Also there is type pobject, that allows to send lisp object with pointer slot or C-pointer. No verbose documentation yet, sorry.
